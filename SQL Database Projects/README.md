# SQL Database Projects

These projects were completed as part of my **CS 445: Introduction to Database Systems** course at Pacific University.
The course covered implimentations using the SQL Programming Language, including:

- The relational model and relational algebra
- ER diagram construction and normalization
- Relational database design
- Query writing using SQL
- Indexing and query optimization
- Transaction management and concurrency
- Web-enabled database architecture using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- Security and access control

Projects were managed using GitHub Classroom and implemented with version control best practices.

## Mock Software Company DB

This was the **first major project** in the course and focused entirely on database design and SQL. I created a relational schema for a fictional software company, including ER diagrams and table structures. This project served as a practical application of course topics and helped reinforce core database design principles.

**Programs Used:**
- SQL in MariaDB
- UMLet to create ER diagrams

## Online Bookstore DB

This was the **final project** of the course, created with one other student. We designed and implemented a mock online bookstore, applying everything learned during the semester to a real-world web application. While the system was fully operational in terms of functionality, it was based on a **static dataset** — a snapshot representing the bookstore’s catalog, users, and orders at one moment in time.


**Programs Used:**
- SQL in MariaDB
- PHP
- HTML/CSS
- MongoDB
- Redis
