# SQL Database Projects

These projects were completed as part of my **CS 445: Introduction to Database Systems** course at Pacific University, taught by Professor Chadd Williams in Spring 2024.

The course covered both theoretical and practical aspects of database systems using MySQL, with emphasis on:

- The relational model and relational algebra
- ER diagram construction and normalization
- Relational database design (conceptual, logical, physical)
- Query writing using SQL
- Indexing and query optimization
- Transaction management and concurrency
- Web-enabled database architecture using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- Security and access control

Projects were managed using GitHub Classroom and implemented with version control best practices.

## ðŸ“‚ Mock Software Company DB (Individual Project)

This was the **first major project** in the course and focused entirely on database design and SQL. I created a relational schema for a fictional software company, including ER diagrams and normalized table structures. This project served as a practical application of course topics and helped reinforce core database design principles.

**Programs Used:**
- SQL in MariaDB
- UMLet to create ER diagrams

## ðŸ“‚ Online Bookstore (Team Project)

This was the **final project** of the course, developed collaboratively with one other student. We designed and implemented a fully functional online bookstore, applying everything learned during the semester to a real-world web application.

**Programs Used:**
- SQL in Maria DB
- PHP
- HTML/CSS
- MongoDB
- Redis
