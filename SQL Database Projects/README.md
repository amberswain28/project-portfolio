# SQL Database Projects

These projects were developed as part of my **CS 445: Introduction to Database Systems** course at Pacific University, taught by Professor Chadd Williams in Spring 2024. The course covered both the theory and practical implementation of database systems using MySQL, PHP, and HTML, and emphasized topics such as:

- The relational model and relational algebra
- ER diagrams and database design
- Normalization and indexing
- Query evaluation and SQL optimization
- Transaction management and concurrency
- Security, physical and logical database design
- Web-enabled databases and LAMP stack architecture

All projects were implemented using a modern DBMS and version-controlled through GitHub Classroom.

## ðŸ“‚ Project 1: Mock Software Company DB

This was the **first individual project** in the course and served as a hands-on application of the concepts taught in lectures. I designed and implemented a database for a fictional software company to manage lecture schedules, department details, and internal company resources.

Key focus areas:
- Data modeling and ER diagram design
- Normalization to 3NF
- Writing SQL queries for insert, update, delete, and select operations
- Using PHP and HTML to display and interact with database data

## ðŸ“‚ Project 2: Online Bookstore

This was the **capstone team project**, completed with one partner during the second half of the semester. We split the work evenly to build a fully functional online bookstore that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books.

Key features:
- Full database schema for products, users, orders, and categories
- Backend interaction using PHP and SQL
- Frontend built with HTML/CSS
- Emphasis on database-driven web applications and best practices in relational design

This project demonstrated our ability to apply everything we had learned throughout the course, from conceptual design to practical, real-world implementation.

Let me know if you'd like me to help you paste this directly into GitHub, format it differently, or create README files for each individual project folder too!
